Rather than using my personal agenda every time I want to take a screenshot, how about this.

** TODAY [#A] Take over the world
DEADLINE: <2017-07-28 Fri -1m>

I'd like to be finished with this before the weekend...

** TODO [#A] Skype with president of Antarctica             :world:meetings:
SCHEDULED: <2017-07-24 Mon 21:00>

Not sure what his timezone is...

** TODO Order a pizza                                          :food:dinner:
SCHEDULED: <2017-07-24 Mon 18:00>

** SOMEDAY Rewrite Emacs in Common Lisp :Emacs:elisp:computers:software:programming:
DEADLINE: <2017-07-26 Wed>
:LOGBOOK:
-  State "SOMEDAY"    from "MAYBE"      [2017-07-24 Mon 18:59]
-  State "MAYBE"      from              [2017-07-24 Mon 18:58]
:END:

I mean, since no one has ever tried doing it before...

** CHECK /r/emacs                                            :website:Emacs:
SCHEDULED: <2017-07-29 Sat -1m>
:LOGBOOK:
-  State "CHECK"      from              [2017-07-24 Mon 19:00]
:END:

** WAITING Visit the moon                                     :space:travel:
SCHEDULED: <2017-06-27 Tue>
:LOGBOOK:
-  State "WAITING"    from              [2017-07-24 Mon 19:01]
:END:

Just waiting on that callback from NASA...

** TODO [#C] Get haircut                                    :personal:@town:
SCHEDULED: <2017-07-25 Tue -1m>

Should probably do this before I take over the world.  Want to look my best.  (Not that it will matter once I'm in charge.)

** TODO [#A] Internet                                                :bills:
DEADLINE: <2017-08-21 Mon -1m>
