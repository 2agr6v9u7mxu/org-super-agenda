* org-super-agenda

[[https://melpa.org/#/org-super-agenda][file:https://melpa.org/packages/org-super-agenda-badge.svg]]

This package lets you "supercharge" your Org daily/weekly agenda.  The idea is to group items into sections, rather than having them all in one big list.

Now you can sort-of do this already with custom agenda commands, but when you do that, you lose the daily/weekly aspect of the agenda: items are no longer shown based on deadline/scheduled timestamps, but are shown no-matter-what.

So this package overrides the =org-agenda-finalize-entries= function, which runs just before items are inserted into agenda views.  It runs them through a set of filters that separate them into groups.  Then the groups are inserted into the agenda buffer, and any remaining items are inserted at the end.  Empty groups are not displayed.

The end result is your standard daily/weekly agenda, but arranged into groups defined by you.  You might put items with certain tags in one group, habits in another group, items with certain todo keywords in another, and items with certain priorities in another.  The possibilities are only limited by the grouping functions.

The primary use of this package is for the daily/weekly agenda, made by the =org-agenda-list= command, but it also works for other agenda views, like =org-tags-view=, =org-todo-list=, =org-search-view=, etc.

Here's what a normal agenda looks like:

Here's what the "super" agenda looks like:

There are also a few [[screenshots/index.org][more screenshots]].

** Usage

After installing, run the command =org-super-agenda-mode=, then set the variable =org-super-agenda-groups= as desired.  The variable should be a list of groups.  Then run an agenda command, and the entries will be grouped!

Here's the code for the example above.  You can test it quickly by evaluating this form:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (let ((org-super-agenda-groups
         '(;; Each group has an implicit boolean OR operator between its selectors.
           (:name "Today"  ; Optionally specify section name
                  :time t  ; Items that have a time associated
                  :todo "TODAY")  ; Items that have this TODO keyword
           (:name "Important"
                  ;; Single arguments given alone
                  :tag "bills"
                  :priority "A")
           ;; Set order of multiple groups at once
           (:order-multi (2 (:name "Shopping in town"
                                   ;; Boolean AND group matches items that match all subgroups
                                   :and (:tag "shopping" :tag "@town"))
                            (:name "Food-related"
                                   ;; Multiple args given in list with implicit OR
                                   :tag ("food" "dinner"))
                            (:name "Personal"
                                   :habit t
                                   :tag "personal")
                            (:name "Space-related (non-moon-or-planet-related)"
                                   ;; Regexps match case-insensitively on the entire entry
                                   :and (:regexp ("space" "NASA")
                                                 ;; Boolean NOT also has implicit OR between selectors
                                                 :not (:regexp "moon" :tag "planet")))))
           ;; Groups supply their own section names when none are given
           (:todo "WAITING" :order 8)  ; Set order of this section
           (:todo ("SOMEDAY" "TO-READ" "CHECK" "TO-WATCH" "WATCHING")
                  ;; Show this group at the end of the agenda (since it has the
                  ;; highest number). If you specified this group last, items
                  ;; with these todo keywords that e.g. have priority A would be
                  ;; displayed in that group instead, because items are grouped
                  ;; out in the order the groups are listed.
                  :order 9)
           (:priority<= "B"
                        ;; Show this section after "Today" and "Important", because
                        ;; their order is unspecified, defaulting to 0. Sections
                        ;; are displayed lowest-number-first.
                        :order 1)
           ;; After the last group, the agenda will display items that didn't
           ;; match any of these groups, with the default order position of 99
           )))
    (org-agenda nil "a"))
#+END_SRC

The groups apply to all agenda commands (at least, every one that calls =org-agenda-finalize-entries=).  You can set different groups for custom commands by setting =org-super-agenda-groups= in the custom command's =settings= list (see the description for =org-agenda-custom-commands=).  You can disable grouping by binding =org-agenda-super-groups= to nil around a call to an agenda command, or you can disable it globally by disabling the mode.

*** Group selectors

Each group selector takes an argument which can be a single atom or a list, e.g. =:tag= takes a string or list of strings.  Some selectors are predicates, like =:deadline= or =:habit=; for consistency, they also take an argument, but it is ignored.  

A group selector creates a section in the agenda containing the items it matches, and any items it doesn't match are passed to the next group selector.

=:discard= is a special exception to this: it simply discards any items it matches, and passes through the rest to the next group selector.

Note that the =:not= group selector /creates/ a group with items it /does not/ match; it can be combined with =:discard= to discard items that /don't/ match, e.g. ~(:discard (:not (:priority "A")))~ as the first selector would mean that only priority =A= items would appear in the agenda, while ~(:discard (:priority "C"))~ would mean that any priority =C= items would not appear in the agenda.

*Special selectors*:

+  =:and= Group ITEMS that match all selectors in GROUP.
+  =:anything= Select every item, no matter what.  This is probably most useful with =:discard=, because it doesn't actually test anything, so it's faster than, e.g. ~:regexp "."~, which has to get the entry text for every item.
+  =:discard= Discard items that don't match selectors.  Any groups processed after this one will not see discarded items.  You might use this at the beginning or end of a list of groups, either to narrow down the list of items (used in combination with =:not=), or to exclude items you're not interested in.
+  =:not= Group ITEMS that match no selectors in GROUP.
+  =:order= A number setting the order sections will be displayed in the agenda, lowest number first.  Defaults to =0=.
+  =:order-multi= Set the order of multiple groups at once, like ~(:order-multi (2 (groupA) (groupB) ...))~ to set the order of these groups to 2.

*Normal selectors:*

+  =:children= Group items that have children.  You might use this to select items that are project top-level headings.
+  =:deadline= Group items that have deadlines.
+  =:habit= Group habit items. Habit items have a "STYLE: habit" Org property.
+  =:heading-regexp= Group items whose headings match any of the given regular expressions.
+  =:priority= Group items that match any of the given priorities. Argument may be a string or list of strings, which should be the priority letter, e.g. =A=.
+  =:priority>= Group items that are higher than the given priority, e.g. =C=.
+  =:priority>== Group items that are higher than or equal to the given priority, e.g. =B=.
+  =:priority<= Group items that are lower than the given priority, e.g. =A=.
+  =:priority<== Group items that are lower than or equal to the given priority, e.g. =B=.
+  =:regexp= Group items that match any of the given regular expressions.
+  =:scheduled= Group items that are scheduled.
+  =:tag= Group items that match any of the given tags. Argument may be a string or list of strings.
+  =:time= Group items that have a time associated. Items with an associated timestamp that has a time (rather than just a date) are selected.
+  =:todo= Group items that match any of the given TODO keywords. Argument may be a string or list of strings, or =t= to match any keyword, or =nil= to match only non-todo items.

** Installation

Install =org-super-agenda= from MELPA.  Then:

1.  Add to your init file: ~(use-package org-super-agenda :config (org-super-agenda-mode))~.
2.  Set the =org-super-agenda-groups= variable.  Use the example code above as a guideline.
3.  Start the day with confidence, knowing that nothing important has been lost in the jumble of /ahem/ overdue items.

** Development

Contributions and feedback are welcome.

If you find this useful, I'd appreciate if you would share a screenshot or two of your agenda views using it (minus any private data, of course).  I'd like to get ideas for how to better organize my agenda.  :)

*** Bugs

+ The =org-search-view= agenda command does not seem to set the =todo-state= text property for items it finds, so the =:todo= selector doesn't work with it.  We should be able to work around this by getting the todo state for each item manually, but we have to make sure that we only do that when necessary, otherwise it might be slow.  And I wouldn't be surprised if there are other selectors that don't work with this or other commands, but =org-agenda-list= should work fine, and =org-tags-view= and =org-todo-list= seem to work.
